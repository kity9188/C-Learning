# C Learning

* C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language.
* Developed in 1972 by **Dennis M. Ritchie** at the **Bell Telephone Laboratories** to develop the UNIX operating system.

## Facts about C
* C is the most commonly used programming language for writing Operating System.
* **C** was invented to write the first OS - **UNIX**.
* The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
* In the later years of C, the WINDOWS_OS, MAC_OS or Linux_OS, all written in C.
* In modern days, most of the machines are programmed using C. e.g., Microcontroller, Microprocessor all are programmed using C.

## Why use C?
* If having no prior knowledge of programming, C is the best language to learn; because **C** is the **mother** of most of the programming **languages**. 
* Even most of the modern languages are written in **C**. e.g., _PHP_, _PERL_ or _PYTHON_ are all written in **C**.

### Prerequisite
1. Editor: It helps to write our code.
2. **Compiler**: It is a small program or a small tool, which converts our program to the machine language. Because our machine just understands 0 and 1.

### Download Links:
[Code Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/home) | Code Blocks is open source and cross platform, so can be used in any OS.
[Binary link](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26) | Download the source code with mingw (i.e., compiler with editor).

	**mingw** is the compiler.

[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) | For downloading and installing eclipse, we need three things viz., Eclipse IDE, C [compiler](http://www.equation.com/servlet/equation.cmd?fa=fortran) and JDK (JDK or JRE because Eclipse is a JAVA IDE, has JAVA dependancy). | Download and install all these.
