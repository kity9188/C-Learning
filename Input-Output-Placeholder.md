# Input / Output / Placeholder

## 1.Placeholder
Suppose we want to print number a number(say32). But simply we can't use ```printf(32)``. This will give error because **printf** only prints **strings**. But printf has methods for printing numbers. What we do is put a **place holder** format code in the string.
We write ```printf("%d",32);``
